Hello! We have a lot of code, but not all of it made it into the final game in it's full form. For example remote.ml fully implements a client and server model used for multiplayer. It works, but we weren't able to implement the multiplayer game mode fully so it's not entirely in the game. Also, we had hopes for a nice menu (menu.ml and menu_state.ml) that we didn't have time to fully implement. However, even with those removed, we have plently of lines of code.
